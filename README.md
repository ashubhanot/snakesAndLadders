<h1>(INVISIBLE) SNAKES AND LADDERS</h1>

## Intro

This is a simple game of snakes and ladders, with a slight, realistic, twist - the snakes and ladders are invisible, just like in real life. #deep

## Getting started

[Click here to open game (opens on current page)](https://pages.git.generalassemb.ly/ashu/project-1-game/)

It's pretty simple to play this game. There is a "Start New Game!" button and a "Roll Dice" button. There are two message boxes - one for displaying who's turn it is, and the other for displaying the die roll value. Hit the "Start New Game!" button and just follow the instructions in the main message box.

## Technologies used
- Javascript, CSS, HTML, JQuery, Ashu's brain 

<br>

## Planned future enhancements
The Mona Lisa, the Rick Roll song, and Ashu's Invisible Snakes and Ladders Game are examples of art that one cannot justify enhancing. However, sometimes you have to destroy something perfect to make it beautiful. And that is what I would do to this perfect piece of art. Add more CSS styling across the app (*yuck*) and produce a lame version with images of snakes and ladders super-imposed on the grid (*yawn*).

Additionally, I would like to add the ability to choose the number of players, and possibly have an option for a computer player.
